# Git Ongoing examples

This file is a work-in-progress with relevant examples and notes of the project being progressed.

## Geo Project

I will continue developing this project on the feature-geo, which is a feature branch taken of the 'develop' develop branch.

`git checkout develop`
`git checkout -b geofeature develop`



##### Simplify the code to one procedure

Simplify the code so that there is only one function.

Replace any complex operators or functions with ones that can easily translate to Suunto.

git checkout -b feature-simplify develop

`git checkout develop`
`git checkout -b geofeature develop`
